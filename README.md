# Home Loan Approval Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes home loan approval data from the Dream Housing Finance Company. The goal is to understand how various factors such as credit history, property area, gender, and income influence the loan approval process. The analysis was conducted using Python, with a focus on data exploration, cleaning, and visualization.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle. It contains information on home loan applications, including details such as:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Number of Dependents
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Property Area
- Loan Status (Approved/Rejected)

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
    - Loaded the dataset and explored the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.
    - Checked for missing values and handled them using the `dropna()` method.
    - Used summary statistics to get an overview of the data.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
    - Analyzed the impact of credit history on loan approval rates.
    - Examined the average loan amount for different property areas.
    - Compared the number of self-employed applicants by gender.
    - Explored the relationship between applicant income and loan amount using scatter plots.
    - Investigated how marital status and number of dependents influence property area distribution.

3. **Results and Conclusions**
    - Identified that credit history has a significant impact on loan approval rates.
    - Found that rural property areas have the highest average loan amounts.
    - Observed that males generally have higher average incomes compared to females.
    - Concluded that applicants with good credit history are more likely to have their loans approved.
